# Bonsall Art Trail

This work is for sale as part of the <a href="https://www.bonsallartstrail.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bonsall Art Trail</a>.

Although sales are conducted through the BAT administration, customers will be put in touch with me to arrange collection. To avoid the problem of transit damage, extra costs, and insurance claims I would like to meet face to face so that you can inspect your purchase before we part. I live a few miles from Bonsall and ideally you would collect it from at my studio. There may be an opportunity to arrange a rendezvous in Bonsall after the sale weekend if you contact me after Monday 5th April.
