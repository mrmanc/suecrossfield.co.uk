# Enquiries

## Buying work

To avoid the problem of transit damage, extra costs, and insurance claims I prefer to sell work face to face so that you can inspect your purchase. For this reason, I mostly only sell at organised events (see below). I can also meet you locally to complete a sale. Sadly this means if you are not based in the UK I will be unable to sell to you.

## Contact me

I am based in Ashbourne in Derbyshire. You can <a href="mailto:sue@suecrossfield.co.uk" title="Click here to email" class="email">contact me by email on sue@suecrossfield.co.uk</a>.
